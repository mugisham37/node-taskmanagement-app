# TypeScript Error Resolution Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of TypeScript errors throughout the Unified Enterprise Platform project. The project currently has a comprehensive architecture but suffers from TypeScript compilation errors across multiple layers that prevent successful builds and development workflow. This spec focuses on a bottom-up, layer-by-layer approach to eliminate all TypeScript errors while maintaining architectural integrity and preventing cascading error regression.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Foundation Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all foundational TypeScript configuration and shared types to be error-free, so that higher-level components can build upon a solid type foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript configuration files are processed THEN `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `vitest.config.ts`, and `drizzle.config.ts` SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN shared types are compiled THEN all files in `src/shared/types/` SHALL have zero TypeScript errors
3. WHEN shared enums are compiled THEN all files in `src/shared/enums/` SHALL have proper TypeScript enum syntax
4. WHEN shared constants are compiled THEN all files in `src/shared/constants/` SHALL have proper type annotations
5. WHEN foundation validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit src/shared/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 2: Error Handling Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all error classes to have proper TypeScript inheritance and typing, so that error handling throughout the application is type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN base error class is compiled THEN `app-error.ts` SHALL have proper TypeScript Error class extension
2. WHEN derived error classes are compiled THEN all error classes SHALL properly inherit from base error with correct typing
3. WHEN error serialization is used THEN error properties SHALL have proper type annotations
4. WHEN error validation runs THEN all error classes SHALL extend properly with no TypeScript errors
5. WHEN error hierarchy is tested THEN inheritance chain SHALL work flawlessly with strong typing

### Requirement 3: Domain Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all domain entities, value objects, and services to be strongly typed, so that business logic is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN value objects are compiled THEN all value objects SHALL be immutable with proper readonly properties
2. WHEN domain entities are compiled THEN entities SHALL use value objects instead of primitives for domain concepts
3. WHEN domain events are compiled THEN event system SHALL be strongly typed with proper interfaces
4. WHEN repository interfaces are compiled THEN contracts SHALL have proper generic typing and async patterns
5. WHEN domain validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit src/domain/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 4: Application Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all CQRS components, handlers, and application services to be type-safe, so that application logic is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CQRS infrastructure is compiled THEN command and query buses SHALL have proper generic typing
2. WHEN commands and queries are compiled THEN all commands/queries SHALL have proper validation and immutability
3. WHEN handlers are compiled THEN all handlers SHALL use proper dependency injection interfaces
4. WHEN application services are compiled THEN services SHALL have proper orchestration logic typing
5. WHEN application validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit src/application/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 5: Infrastructure Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all infrastructure components to have proper TypeScript integration, so that external service interactions are type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database schema is compiled THEN Drizzle ORM integration SHALL have proper TypeScript syntax
2. WHEN repository implementations are compiled THEN repositories SHALL implement domain interfaces exactly
3. WHEN external service integrations are compiled THEN service clients SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN caching services are compiled THEN cache operations SHALL have proper async typing
5. WHEN infrastructure validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit src/infrastructure/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 6: Presentation Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API controllers, DTOs, and middleware to be type-safe, so that HTTP layer interactions are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DTOs are compiled THEN all DTOs SHALL have proper validation decorators and type annotations
2. WHEN controllers are compiled THEN controllers SHALL have proper Fastify integration typing
3. WHEN middleware is compiled THEN middleware SHALL have proper request/response typing
4. WHEN route handlers are compiled THEN handlers SHALL have proper parameter validation
5. WHEN presentation validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit src/presentation/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 7: Integration Layer TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application bootstrap and dependency injection to be type-safe, so that the application starts without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN main application files are compiled THEN `index.ts`, `server.ts`, and `app.ts` SHALL have zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN dependency injection is compiled THEN service registration SHALL have proper type safety
3. WHEN configuration is compiled THEN environment configuration SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN container validation runs THEN dependency resolution SHALL be type-safe
5. WHEN integration validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit` SHALL pass for entire project

### Requirement 8: Test Infrastructure TypeScript Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to be type-safe, so that testing infrastructure supports development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test configuration is compiled THEN test setup files SHALL have proper TypeScript integration
2. WHEN test helpers are compiled THEN test utilities SHALL have proper type definitions
3. WHEN unit tests are compiled THEN test files SHALL have proper typing for mocks and assertions
4. WHEN integration tests are compiled THEN test database setup SHALL have proper type safety
5. WHEN test validation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit tests/**/*.ts` SHALL pass with zero errors

### Requirement 9: Build and Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire project to build successfully with strict TypeScript settings, so that code quality is maintained at the highest level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN full compilation runs THEN `tsc --noEmit` SHALL pass with zero errors for entire project
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN `npm run lint` SHALL pass with zero TypeScript-related errors
3. WHEN tests run THEN `npm test` SHALL execute without TypeScript compilation errors
4. WHEN build runs THEN `npm run build` SHALL complete successfully with no warnings
5. WHEN quality gates run THEN all TypeScript strict mode checks SHALL pass

### Requirement 10: Error Prevention and Regression Protection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic error prevention measures, so that TypeScript errors don't reoccur after resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is added THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate TypeScript compilation
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN type compatibility SHALL be validated automatically
3. WHEN refactoring occurs THEN type safety SHALL be maintained throughout changes
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN TypeScript validation SHALL be enforced at build time
5. WHEN development continues THEN incremental TypeScript checking SHALL prevent error accumulation
