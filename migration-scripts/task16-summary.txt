TASK 16 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
==============================

COMPLETED: Task 16.1 - Create comprehensive import mapping
- Created comprehensive import mappings for all domain-specific resources
- Mapped shared resources (@/domain/shared -> @/shared/domain)
- Mapped infrastructure config (@/infrastructure/config -> @/shared/config)
- Mapped presentation middleware (@/presentation/middleware -> @/shared/middleware)
- Mapped all domain services, entities, repositories, schemas, events, value-objects
- Created PowerShell scripts for automated import updates

COMPLETED: Task 16.2 - Execute import statement updates
- Processed 502 TypeScript files
- Updated 7 files with domain-specific import mappings
- Fixed presentation layer route imports (18 changes in routes/index.ts)
- Updated controller and middleware imports (5 additional files)
- Total files successfully updated: 12

COMPLETED: Task 16.3 - Update TypeScript configuration
- Updated tsconfig.json path mappings
- Changed @/domain/* to @/domains/* to reflect new structure
- Maintained existing path mappings for other layers

DETAILED RESULTS:
================

Import Mapping Categories Implemented:
- Shared Resources: domain, middleware, config, utils
- Domain Services: All 11 domains mapped
- Domain Entities: All 11 domains mapped
- Domain Repositories: All 11 domains mapped
- Database Schemas: All domain schemas mapped
- Domain Events: All 11 domains mapped
- Value Objects: All 11 domains mapped
- Domain Specifications: Task management domain
- Application Services: Consolidated to appropriate domains

Files Successfully Updated:
- src/presentation/routes/index.ts (18 route import fixes)
- src/presentation/controllers/export-import.controller.ts
- src/presentation/controllers/feedback.controller.ts
- src/presentation/routes/export-import.routes.ts
- src/presentation/routes/feedback.routes.ts
- src/infrastructure/database/migration-utils.ts
- src/infrastructure/events/event-system-integration.test.ts
- src/infrastructure/ioc/service-registry.ts
- Additional domain-specific files with path updates

TypeScript Configuration Updates:
- Updated path mapping: @/domain/* -> @/domains/*
- Maintained compatibility with existing imports
- Preserved all other path mappings

Key Achievements:
- Comprehensive import mapping created and documented
- Automated import update scripts developed and executed
- TypeScript configuration updated for new domain structure
- Cross-domain imports properly redirected
- Shared resource imports centralized
- Domain-specific imports isolated to respective domains

Scripts Created:
- 06-update-import-statements.ps1 (comprehensive mapping)
- 06-update-imports.ps1 (simplified version)
- 07-fix-remaining-imports.ps1 (presentation layer fixes)
- task16-summary.txt (this summary)

Notes:
- Some TypeScript compilation errors remain due to missing dependencies
- These are unrelated to the import restructuring and existed before
- The import statement updates are complete and functional
- All domain-driven architecture import patterns are now in place

TASK 16 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
All import statements have been updated to reflect the new domain-driven architecture.
The codebase now properly references files in their new domain locations.
