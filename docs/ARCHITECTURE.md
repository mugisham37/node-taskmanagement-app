# Unified Enterprise Platform - Architecture

## Overview

The Unified Enterprise Platform follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with a clean architecture approach. The system combines enterprise-grade authentication with comprehensive task management capabilities.

## Domain Architecture

### Core Domains

1. **Authentication Domain**
   - User management and authentication
   - Session management
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - OAuth integration

2. **Task Management Domain**
   - Workspace management
   - Project organization
   - Task lifecycle management
   - Team collaboration
   - Template system

3. **Calendar Domain**
   - Event management
   - External calendar integration
   - Scheduling and reminders
   - Availability tracking

4. **Collaboration Domain**
   - Real-time updates
   - Comments and mentions
   - File attachments
   - Activity tracking

5. **Notification Domain**
   - Multi-channel notifications
   - Preference management
   - Webhook system
   - Email and SMS delivery

6. **Analytics Domain**
   - Activity tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Reporting and dashboards
   - Data visualization

### Supporting Domains

1. **Audit Domain**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Compliance tracking
   - Security monitoring
   - Data governance

2. **File Management Domain**
   - Secure file storage
   - Version control
   - Access control
   - Multiple storage backends

3. **Integration Domain**
   - External service integration
   - Data import/export
   - API management
   - Webhook handling

## Layer Responsibilities

### Domain Layer

- Contains business logic and rules
- Defines entities, value objects, and aggregates
- Implements domain services
- Publishes domain events
- Independent of external concerns

### Application Layer

- Orchestrates domain operations
- Implements use cases
- Handles application services
- Manages transactions
- Coordinates between domains

### Infrastructure Layer

- Implements external concerns
- Database access and ORM
- External service integrations
- Caching and messaging
- Configuration management

### Presentation Layer

- HTTP API endpoints
- Request/response handling
- Authentication middleware
- Input validation
- WebSocket connections

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

- Abstracts data access logic
- Provides clean separation between domain and infrastructure
- Enables easy testing with mock implementations

### Factory Pattern

- Creates complex domain objects
- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Provides consistent object initialization

### Event-Driven Architecture

- Decouples domain operations
- Enables cross-domain communication
- Supports eventual consistency
- Facilitates integration with external systems

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

- Separates read and write operations
- Optimizes for different access patterns
- Enables independent scaling
- Supports complex reporting requirements

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. User credentials validation
2. JWT token generation with workspace context
3. Role and permission assignment
4. Session management with Redis
5. Multi-factor authentication support

### Authorization Model

- Hierarchical permissions (Workspace → Project → Task)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource-level permissions
- Dynamic permission evaluation

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance features
- Audit trail for all operations
- Secure file storage with access control

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- Multi-layer caching (Memory → Redis → Database)
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Cache warming strategies
- Performance monitoring

### Database Optimization

- Connection pooling
- Read replicas for scaling
- Optimized indexes
- Query performance monitoring

### Real-time Features

- WebSocket connection management
- Event broadcasting optimization
- Connection pooling by workspace
- Intelligent subscription management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Domain entity testing
- Service layer testing
- Repository testing with mocks
- Utility function testing

### Integration Testing

- Cross-domain integration
- Database integration
- External service integration
- API endpoint testing

### End-to-End Testing

- Complete workflow testing
- User journey validation
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization

- Docker containers for all services
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks and monitoring
- Horizontal scaling support

### Monitoring and Observability

- Structured logging with Winston
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Distributed tracing
- Error tracking and alerting

### Development Environment

- Docker Compose for local development
- Hot reloading with TypeScript
- Automated testing pipeline
- Code quality enforcement
