- ✅ `notification-queue.service.ts` - Moved from application layer

### Search Domain (`src/domain/search/services/`)

- ✅ `search.service.ts` - Moved from application layer

### Task Management Domain (`src/domain/task-management/services/`)

- ✅ `invitation.service.ts` - Moved from application layer

### Calendar Domain (`src/domain/calendar/services/`)

- ✅ `calendar-event.service.ts` - Moved from application layer
- ✅ `calendar.service.ts` - Moved from application layer

### Webhook Domain (`src/domain/webhook/services/`)

- ✅ `webhook-analytics.service.ts` - Moved from application layer
- ✅ `webhook-delivery.service.impl.ts` - Moved from application layer
- ✅ `webhook-management.service.ts` - Moved from application layer (replaced existing)
- ✅ `webhook-management.service.impl.ts` - Moved from application layer
- ✅ `webhook-testing.service.ts` - Moved from application layer
- ✅ `webhook-event-dispatcher.service.impl.ts` - Moved from application layer

## Services Remaining in Application Layer

These services correctly remain in the application layer as they are either:

- Cross-cutting infrastructure services
- Application orchestration services
- Cross-domain services

### Remaining Services:

- ✅ `base.service.ts` - Base infrastructure service
- ✅ `calendar-event.application.service.ts` - Application orchestration service
- ✅ `calendar-integration.application.service.ts` - Application orchestration service
- ✅ `data-import-export.service.ts` - Cross-domain application service
- ✅ `email.service.ts` - Infrastructure service
- ✅ `feedback.service.ts` - Cross-domain application service
- ✅ `websocket.service.ts` - Infrastructure service
- ✅ `websocket.service!.ts` - Infrastructure service (duplicate)

## New Domain Folders Created

- ✅ `src/domain/collaboration/` - For collaboration-related services
- ✅ `src/domain/system-monitoring/` - For system monitoring services

## Next Steps Required

1. **Update Import Statements**: All files that import the moved services need their import paths updated
2. **Update IoC Container Registrations**: Service registry needs to be updated with new paths
3. **Update Tests**: Test files need import path updates
4. **Update Index Files**: Domain index files need to export the new services
5. **Remove Duplicate Services**: Clean up any duplicate websocket services

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Domain Boundaries Respected**: Services are now properly organized by domain
- ✅ **Clean Architecture Maintained**: Domain logic is encapsulated within domain boundaries
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Application orchestration vs domain logic clearly separated
- ✅ **Improved Maintainability**: Related services are co-located
- ✅ **Better Testability**: Domain services can be tested in isolation
- ✅ **Enhanced Scalability**: Each domain can evolve independently

## Total Services Moved: 32

## Total Services Remaining in Application: 8

## New Domain Folders Created: 2
