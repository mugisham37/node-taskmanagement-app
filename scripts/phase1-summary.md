   - Created `src/domain/shared/base/aggregate-root.ts` with version control
   - Implemented domain event publishing with automatic versioning
   - Added template methods for validation and business rules
   - Integrated with existing BaseEntity structure

2. **Advanced Domain Service Base**
   - Created `src/domain/shared/base/domain-service.ts` with operation templates
   - Added validation interfaces and error handling patterns
   - Implemented consistent logging and metrics collection
   - Provided base classes for complex business logic coordination

3. **Enhanced Task Entity**
   - Updated Task entity to extend AggregateRoot instead of BaseEntity
   - Added comprehensive validation methods
   - Implemented automatic business rule enforcement
   - Enhanced domain event publishing with proper change tracking

4. **Comprehensive Task Management Domain Service**
   - Created `src/domain/task-management/services/task-management.domain-service.ts`
   - Implements complex business operations across multiple aggregates
   - Includes task dependency validation, assignment validation, bulk operations
   - Provides task metrics calculation and assignment suggestions
   - Full validation framework with detailed error reporting

### Key Features:

- **Rich Domain Logic**: Comprehensive business rule enforcement

## ✅ Task 3: Repository Interface Completion - COMPLETED

### What was implemented:

1. **Specification Pattern Implementation**
   - Created `src/domain/shared/base/specification.ts` with composable query building
   - Supports AND, OR, NOT operations for complex queries
   - Converts specifications to database queries automatically
   - Enables type-safe, reusable query conditions

2. **Enhanced Repository Base Classes**
   - Created `src/domain/shared/base/repository.ts` with common CRUD operations
   - Implemented specification-based querying
   - Added batch operations and existence checks
   - Provided factory pattern for repository creation

3. **Comprehensive Task Specifications**
   - Created `src/domain/task-management/specifications/task-specifications.ts`
   - 15+ pre-built specifications for common task queries
   - Includes workspace, project, assignee, status, priority filters
   - Advanced specifications for overdue tasks, text search, date ranges
   - Composable specifications for complex query building

4. **Unit of Work Pattern**
   - Created `src/domain/shared/base/unit-of-work.ts` with transaction management
   - Supports nested transactions and automatic rollback
   - Includes retry logic for deadlock handling
   - Provides transactional decorators for automatic transaction management
   - Transaction scope pattern for batch operations

5. **Updated Task Repository**
   - Enhanced existing TaskRepository to use specification pattern
   - Added specification-based query methods

## Next Steps

Phase 1 provides the solid foundation for the remaining phases. The database is optimized, domain entities are rich with business logic, and the repository layer provides flexible, performant data access. This foundation supports:

- Dependency injection system (Phase 2)
- Infrastructure implementations (Phase 3)
- Event-driven architecture (Phase 4)
- Application layer orchestration (Phase 5)
- All subsequent phases build upon this foundation

## Usage Examples

### Database Setup

```bash
npm run setup-database
```

### Using Specifications

```typescript
const spec = new TasksByWorkspaceSpecification(workspaceId)
  .and(
    new TasksByStatusSpecification([TaskStatus.todo(), TaskStatus.inProgress()])
  )
  .and(new OverdueTasksSpecification());

const overdueTasks = await taskRepository.findBySpecification(spec);
```

### Using Unit of Work

```typescript
const scope = new TransactionScope(() => unitOfWorkFactory.create());
await scope.execute(async uow => {
  const task = await uow.tasks.findById(taskId);
  task.changeStatus(TaskStatus.done(), userId);
  await uow.tasks.save(task);
  await uow.saveChanges();
});
```

### Domain Service Usage

```typescript
const taskService = new TaskManagementDomainService(taskRepository);
const validation = await taskService.validate(task);
const metrics = await taskService.calculateProjectTaskMetrics(projectId);
```
