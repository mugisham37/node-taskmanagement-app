# Enterprise Platform Unification - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Unified Enterprise Platform is currently a collection of well-designed but disconnected components that need to be transformed into a fully integrated, production-ready, enterprise-grade task management backend. The system has excellent architectural foundations with Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, and comprehensive features, but lacks the cohesive integration that makes all layers work together as a single, unified machine.

The goal is to unify all layers - from the database schema through domain entities, application services, infrastructure implementations, and presentation controllers - ensuring every component is properly connected, utilized, and contributing to the overall system functionality.
