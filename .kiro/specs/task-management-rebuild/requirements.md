# Task Management Project Complete Rebuild - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completely rebuilding and optimizing the existing Node.js task management application. The current project suffers from over-engineering, structural bloat with 47+ empty directories, dual ORM conflicts (Prisma + Drizzle), incomplete implementations, and disconnected components. The goal is to transform this into a production-ready, enterprise-grade system that works seamlessly as one cohesive backend using Clean Architecture principles with CQRS pattern and Drizzle ORM exclusively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, purposeful project structure with no empty directories, so that I can navigate and maintain the codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rebuild is complete THEN the system SHALL have zero empty directories
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN every directory SHALL contain files that contribute to the system functionality
3. WHEN navigating the codebase THEN the structure SHALL follow Clean Architecture with clear layer separation
4. IF a directory exists THEN it SHALL contain at least one functional file
5. WHEN the structure is analyzed THEN it SHALL have maximum 4 layers: domain, application, infrastructure, presentation

### Requirement 2: Database Layer Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use only Drizzle ORM for all database operations, so that I can avoid conflicts and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL use only Drizzle ORM for database operations
2. WHEN examining dependencies THEN Prisma SHALL be completely removed from package.json
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use Drizzle's type-safe query builder
4. IF database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL use Drizzle's migration system
5. WHEN repository implementations are created THEN they SHALL implement interfaces using Drizzle exclusively

### Requirement 3: Complete Domain Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want all business logic properly implemented in the domain layer, so that business rules are enforced consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business operations are performed THEN domain entities SHALL enforce all business invariants
2. WHEN creating domain objects THEN value objects SHALL validate all input data
3. WHEN complex business operations occur THEN aggregates SHALL maintain consistency boundaries
4. IF business rules change THEN domain services SHALL encapsulate complex business logic
5. WHEN domain events occur THEN they SHALL be properly published and handled

### Requirement 4: Application Layer Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want complete use case implementations that orchestrate domain operations, so that business workflows are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are received THEN use cases SHALL orchestrate all necessary domain operations
2. WHEN commands are processed THEN command handlers SHALL validate input and execute business logic
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN query handlers SHALL return properly formatted data
4. IF transactions are needed THEN use cases SHALL manage transaction boundaries
5. WHEN errors occur THEN application services SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 5: Infrastructure Layer Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified infrastructure layer with only essential services, so that the system is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external services are needed THEN infrastructure SHALL provide clean abstractions
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN repositories SHALL implement domain interfaces
3. WHEN caching is required THEN a single cache service SHALL handle all caching needs
4. IF monitoring is needed THEN observability services SHALL provide health checks and metrics
5. WHEN security is required THEN authentication and authorization SHALL be properly implemented

### Requirement 6: Complete API Implementation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want complete REST API endpoints with proper validation and error handling, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL provide complete CRUD operations for all entities
2. WHEN requests are made THEN input validation SHALL be performed using Zod schemas
3. WHEN errors occur THEN proper HTTP status codes and error messages SHALL be returned
4. IF authentication is required THEN JWT-based authentication SHALL be enforced
5. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN OpenAPI/Swagger documentation SHALL be available

### Requirement 7: Real-time Features

**User Story:** As an end user, I want real-time updates for task changes, so that I can collaborate effectively with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are created, updated, or completed THEN WebSocket notifications SHALL be sent to relevant users
2. WHEN users are online THEN presence indicators SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN collaborative editing occurs THEN changes SHALL be synchronized in real-time
4. IF connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
5. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL be properly authenticated and authorized

### Requirement 8: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to be production-ready with proper monitoring, logging, and security, so that it can be deployed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available at all levels
2. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN health checks and metrics SHALL be exposed
3. WHEN security threats exist THEN rate limiting and input sanitization SHALL protect the system
4. IF performance issues occur THEN caching and optimization SHALL maintain response times
5. WHEN errors happen THEN they SHALL be properly tracked and reported

### Requirement 9: Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the system reliability is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all domain entities and services
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN integration tests SHALL verify complete request/response cycles
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN repository tests SHALL use test databases
4. IF end-to-end workflows exist THEN E2E tests SHALL verify critical user journeys
5. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL provide coverage reports and pass consistently

### Requirement 10: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration management, so that the system can be deployed in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN environment-specific configurations SHALL be loaded
2. WHEN sensitive data is needed THEN it SHALL be stored in environment variables
3. WHEN feature flags are required THEN they SHALL be configurable per environment
4. IF database connections are needed THEN connection strings SHALL be environment-specific
5. WHEN external services are configured THEN their settings SHALL be environment-aware

### Requirement 11: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast response times and efficient resource usage, so that the application is responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized with proper indexing
2. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN Redis SHALL be used for frequently accessed data
3. WHEN API responses are large THEN pagination SHALL be implemented
4. IF concurrent requests occur THEN connection pooling SHALL manage database connections efficiently
5. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN response times SHALL be tracked and optimized

### Requirement 12: Data Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a business user, I want data consistency and integrity maintained at all times, so that business operations are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business operations span multiple entities THEN transactions SHALL maintain ACID properties
2. WHEN domain invariants exist THEN they SHALL be enforced at the aggregate level
3. WHEN data validation is required THEN it SHALL occur at multiple layers (domain, application, presentation)
4. IF concurrent modifications occur THEN optimistic locking SHALL prevent data corruption
5. WHEN data migrations are needed THEN they SHALL preserve data integrity
