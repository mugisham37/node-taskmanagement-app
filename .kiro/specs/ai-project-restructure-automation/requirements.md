# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for restructuring a TypeScript enterprise project from a traditional layered architecture into a clean, domain-driven architecture. The current project has domains scattered across presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure layers, with significant duplication and unclear boundaries. The goal is to create a self-contained domain structure where each business domain encapsulates all its related functionality (controllers, routes, validators, services, entities, repositories, schemas) while maintaining shared utilities and infrastructure components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain Identification and Analysis

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to identify all existing business domains and their current file distributions, so that I can plan an accurate restructuring strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all business domains from src/domain/ directory
2. WHEN examining presentation layer THEN the system SHALL catalog all controllers, routes, and validators by domain
3. WHEN reviewing application services THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate services between src/application/services/ and src/domain/\*/services/
4. WHEN analyzing infrastructure layer THEN the system SHALL map repositories and schemas to their respective domains
5. WHEN completing analysis THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive mapping document showing current vs target structure

### Requirement 2: Target Architecture Definition

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want a clear target architecture specification, so that the restructuring follows consistent domain-driven design principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining target structure THEN the system SHALL create src/shared/ directory for cross-domain utilities
2. WHEN organizing domains THEN the system SHALL create src/domains/[domain-name]/ structure for each identified domain
3. WHEN structuring domains THEN each domain SHALL contain controllers/, routes/, validators/, services/, entities/, repositories/, schemas/, events/, value-objects/, and specifications/ subdirectories
4. WHEN organizing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL maintain src/infrastructure/ only for technical infrastructure (database connection, cache, external services, monitoring, storage)
5. WHEN defining shared resources THEN the system SHALL organize src/shared/ into domain/, middleware/, config/, utils/, and types/ subdirectories

### Requirement 3: Automated Directory Structure Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated PowerShell scripts to create the new directory structure, so that I can execute the restructuring efficiently and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing directory creation THEN the system SHALL create all shared directories (src/shared/domain, src/shared/middleware, src/shared/config, src/shared/utils, src/shared/types)
2. WHEN creating domain directories THEN the system SHALL generate complete subdirectory structure for each identified domain
3. WHEN organizing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create clean infrastructure directories (database/, cache/, external-services/, monitoring/, storage/)
4. WHEN creating directories THEN the system SHALL use PowerShell New-Item commands with -Force flag to handle existing directories
5. WHEN directory creation completes THEN the system SHALL verify all required directories exist

### Requirement 4: Shared Resources Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared domain classes and utilities moved to centralized locations, so that domains can access common functionality without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN migrating middleware THEN the system SHALL move src/presentation/middleware/\* to src/shared/middleware/
3. WHEN migrating configuration THEN the system SHALL move src/infrastructure/config/\* to src/shared/config/
4. WHEN migrating utilities THEN the system SHALL move src/utils/\* to src/shared/utils/
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL verify no shared resources remain in old locations

### Requirement 5: Domain-Specific File Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all domain-specific files moved to their respective domain directories, so that each domain is self-contained and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating controllers THEN the system SHALL move domain-related controllers from src/presentation/controllers/ to src/domains/[domain]/controllers/
2. WHEN migrating routes THEN the system SHALL move domain-related routes from src/presentation/routes/ to src/domains/[domain]/routes/
3. WHEN migrating validators THEN the system SHALL move domain-related validators from src/presentation/validators/ to src/domains/[domain]/validators/
4. WHEN migrating services THEN the system SHALL consolidate services from both src/application/services/ and src/domain/[domain]/services/ into src/domains/[domain]/services/
5. WHEN migrating entities THEN the system SHALL move src/domain/[domain]/entities/\* to src/domains/[domain]/entities/
6. WHEN migrating repositories THEN the system SHALL move repositories from both src/domain/[domain]/repositories/ and src/infrastructure/database/drizzle/repositories/ to src/domains/[domain]/repositories/
7. WHEN migrating schemas THEN the system SHALL move database schemas from src/infrastructure/database/drizzle/schema/ to src/domains/[domain]/schemas/
8. WHEN migrating events THEN the system SHALL move src/domain/[domain]/events/\* to src/domains/[domain]/events/
9. WHEN migrating value objects THEN the system SHALL move src/domain/[domain]/value-objects/\* to src/domains/[domain]/value-objects/
10. WHEN migrating specifications THEN the system SHALL move src/domain/[domain]/specifications/\* to src/domains/[domain]/specifications/

### Requirement 6: Service Deduplication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate services removed and consolidated, so that there is a single source of truth for each service implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying duplicate services THEN the system SHALL compare services in src/application/services/ with src/domain/[domain]/services/
2. WHEN consolidating services THEN the system SHALL keep domain services and remove application layer duplicates
3. WHEN removing duplicates THEN the system SHALL preserve the most complete and recent implementation
4. WHEN deduplication completes THEN the system SHALL verify no duplicate service implementations exist
5. WHEN services are consolidated THEN the system SHALL update any cross-references between services

### Requirement 7: Infrastructure Layer Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the infrastructure layer cleaned to contain only technical infrastructure, so that domain-specific code is properly separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning infrastructure THEN the system SHALL keep database connection management in src/infrastructure/database/
2. WHEN organizing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL maintain cache/, external-services/, monitoring/, storage/, and websocket/ directories
3. WHEN removing domain code THEN the system SHALL move all domain-specific repositories to their respective domains
4. WHEN removing domain code THEN the system SHALL move all domain-specific schemas to their respective domains
5. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL verify infrastructure contains only technical, non-domain-specific code

### Requirement 8: Import Statement Updates
