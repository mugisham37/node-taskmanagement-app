# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Unified Enterprise Platform requires a complete architectural restructuring to achieve perfect clean architecture principles while maintaining domain-driven design (DDD) organization. The current project has scattered responsibilities, duplicated code, layer violations, and inconsistent patterns that prevent it from operating as a cohesive, high-performance enterprise system.

The restructuring will transform the existing codebase into a perfectly organized, enterprise-grade application following clean architecture and DDD principles, where each layer has clear responsibilities, dependencies flow in one direction, and all components are properly connected and optimized.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Architecture Layer Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to follow strict clean architecture principles, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL have exactly 5 distinct layers: Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Shared
2. WHEN examining layer dependencies THEN the system SHALL enforce the dependency rule: Presentation → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure, with Shared accessible by all
3. WHEN reviewing any domain layer file THEN it SHALL NOT import from infrastructure or presentation layers
4. WHEN checking the presentation layer THEN it SHALL only contain controllers, routes, DTOs, middleware, and WebSocket gateways
5. WHEN examining the application layer THEN it SHALL contain use cases, application services, CQRS handlers, event handlers, and mappers
6. WHEN reviewing the domain layer THEN it SHALL contain aggregates, entities, value objects, domain services, repository interfaces, domain events, and specifications
7. WHEN checking the infrastructure layer THEN it SHALL contain database implementations, external service integrations, caching, logging, monitoring, and security implementations
8. WHEN examining the shared layer THEN it SHALL contain only pure utilities, types, interfaces, constants, enums, guards, decorators, and error definitions

### Requirement 2: Domain-Driven Design Preservation and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want the system to maintain clear domain boundaries while improving domain organization, so that business logic remains isolated and well-structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring domains THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing domain contexts: authentication, task-management, calendar, notification, analytics, audit, collaboration, data-import-export, feedback, file-management, real-time, search, system-monitoring, and webhook
2. WHEN organizing domain entities THEN each domain SHALL have its entities, value objects, and aggregates properly organized within the domain layer
3. WHEN examining domain services THEN they SHALL contain only pure business logic without infrastructure dependencies
4. WHEN reviewing domain events THEN they SHALL be properly defined and published from aggregates
5. WHEN checking repository interfaces THEN they SHALL be defined in the domain layer and implemented in the infrastructure layer
6. WHEN examining domain specifications THEN they SHALL encapsulate business rules and validation logic
7. WHEN reviewing aggregates THEN they SHALL properly encapsulate business invariants and coordinate entity interactions

### Requirement 3: Elimination of Code Duplication and Inconsistencies

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want all code duplication and inconsistencies removed, so that the system has a single source of truth for each concern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining logging implementations THEN there SHALL be exactly one logger service in the infrastructure layer
2. WHEN reviewing caching implementations THEN there SHALL be exactly one cache manager in the infrastructure layer
3. WHEN checking middleware implementations THEN there SHALL be only essential middleware (authentication, error handling, validation, rate limiting) in the presentation layer
4. WHEN examining repository implementations THEN they SHALL follow a consistent pattern across all domains
5. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN they SHALL be centralized in a single configuration layer
6. WHEN checking service implementations THEN there SHALL be no duplicate business logic across domains
7. WHEN examining utility functions THEN they SHALL be consolidated in the shared layer without duplication

### Requirement 4: Perfect System Connectivity and Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all components to be perfectly connected and integrated, so that the system operates as a single, cohesive, high-performance unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all layers SHALL be properly connected through dependency injection
2. WHEN a request flows through the system THEN it SHALL follow the proper layer sequence: Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure
3. WHEN domain events are published THEN they SHALL be properly handled by application event handlers
4. WHEN examining import statements THEN they SHALL follow the correct dependency direction and use proper module boundaries
5. WHEN checking service registrations THEN all services SHALL be properly registered in the IoC container
6. WHEN reviewing database connections THEN they SHALL be properly managed through the infrastructure layer
7. WHEN examining cross-domain communication THEN it SHALL occur through well-defined application services and event handlers
8. WHEN checking external service integrations THEN they SHALL be properly abstracted through infrastructure interfaces

### Requirement 5: Enterprise-Grade Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the restructured system to operate at the highest performance level, so that it can handle enterprise-scale workloads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL have optimized import paths and module loading
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN it SHALL have proper index files for clean imports across all layers
3. WHEN checking database operations THEN they SHALL use proper repository patterns with connection pooling
4. WHEN reviewing caching strategies THEN they SHALL be implemented consistently across all domains
5. WHEN examining error handling THEN it SHALL be centralized and consistent across all layers
6. WHEN checking monitoring and logging THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive system observability
7. WHEN reviewing the build process THEN it SHALL be optimized for production deployment
8. WHEN examining memory usage THEN the system SHALL have proper resource management and cleanup

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Testing Architecture

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the restructured system to have a comprehensive testing architecture, so that all components can be thoroughly tested in isolation and integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the test structure THEN it SHALL have organized test suites for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
2. WHEN reviewing domain tests THEN they SHALL test business logic in isolation without infrastructure dependencies
3. WHEN checking application service tests THEN they SHALL use proper mocking for infrastructure dependencies
4. WHEN examining repository tests THEN they SHALL test data access patterns with proper test databases
5. WHEN reviewing controller tests THEN they SHALL test API contracts and request/response handling
6. WHEN checking integration tests THEN they SHALL verify proper layer communication and data flow
7. WHEN examining test utilities THEN they SHALL provide proper mocks, factories, and test helpers

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want centralized and organized configuration management, so that the system can be easily deployed across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining configuration files THEN they SHALL be centralized in a single configuration layer
2. WHEN reviewing environment-specific configs THEN they SHALL be properly organized by environment (development, staging, production)
3. WHEN checking feature flags THEN they SHALL be properly integrated into the configuration system
4. WHEN examining database configurations THEN they SHALL support multiple database environments
5. WHEN reviewing external service configurations THEN they SHALL be properly abstracted and configurable
6. WHEN checking security configurations THEN they SHALL be properly managed and secured
7. WHEN examining logging configurations THEN they SHALL be environment-appropriate and configurable

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation and clear project structure, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL have clear README files explaining each layer's purpose
2. WHEN reviewing code files THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript types and interfaces
3. WHEN checking API documentation THEN it SHALL be automatically generated and up-to-date
4. WHEN examining domain documentation THEN it SHALL clearly explain business rules and domain concepts
5. WHEN reviewing architecture documentation THEN it SHALL include diagrams and flow explanations
6. WHEN checking development setup THEN it SHALL have clear instructions for local development
7. WHEN examining deployment documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear deployment procedures
