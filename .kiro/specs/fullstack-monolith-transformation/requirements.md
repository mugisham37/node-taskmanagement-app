# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing node-taskmanagement-app from a single API-focused structure into a comprehensive full-stack monolith architecture. This transformation involves extracting shared packages from the existing API application, creating new frontend applications (web, admin, mobile), establishing proper infrastructure, and building a complete development ecosystem with cross-package dependencies, monitoring, and deployment capabilities.

The current project has a sophisticated API built with Clean Architecture, CQRS, and DDD patterns. The goal is to maintain this architectural excellence while expanding it into a full monolith that supports multiple applications sharing common business logic, authentication, database access, and other cross-cutting concerns.
