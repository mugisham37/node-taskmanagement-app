# Monolithic Full-Stack Architecture Transformation - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the current project structure from separate client and server directories into a unified monolithic full-stack architecture. The goal is to create a seamless development experience with optimal communication between frontend and backend, shared resources, unified tooling, and enterprise-level scalability while maintaining the sophisticated backend infrastructure already in place.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Monorepo Structure Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified monorepo structure so that I can manage the entire full-stack application as a cohesive unit with shared dependencies and coordinated development cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the project SHALL have a root-level workspace configuration that manages all packages
2. WHEN developers run build commands THEN the system SHALL coordinate builds across all packages with proper dependency resolution
3. WHEN shared code is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically rebuild dependent packages
4. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL support independent deployment of client and server while maintaining shared resources

### Requirement 2: Shared Type-Safe Communication Layer

**User Story:** As a full-stack developer, I want end-to-end type safety between frontend and backend so that I can catch API contract violations at compile time and have seamless data flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are defined on the server THEN the client SHALL automatically have access to typed API calls
2. WHEN data models change on the server THEN the client SHALL receive compile-time errors for incompatible usage
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL provide automatic request/response validation
4. WHEN real-time features are used THEN WebSocket communications SHALL be type-safe across client and server

### Requirement 3: Shared Business Logic and Utilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to share common business logic, validation schemas, and utilities between client and server so that I can maintain consistency and avoid code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is needed THEN both client and server SHALL use the same validation schemas
2. WHEN business constants are defined THEN they SHALL be accessible from both client and server
3. WHEN utility functions are created THEN they SHALL be reusable across the entire stack
4. WHEN data transformations are needed THEN the same logic SHALL be available on both sides

### Requirement 4: Unified Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single command to start the entire development environment so that I can work efficiently without managing multiple processes manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the dev command THEN both client and server SHALL start simultaneously with hot reload
2. WHEN shared packages are modified THEN all dependent applications SHALL automatically reload
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute tests across all packages with unified reporting
4. WHEN linting or formatting THEN the system SHALL apply consistent rules across the entire codebase

### Requirement 5: High-Performance Real-Time Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates across the application so that I can see changes immediately without manual refresh, with optimal performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes on the server THEN connected clients SHALL receive real-time updates
2. WHEN multiple users collaborate THEN changes SHALL be synchronized across all sessions
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection and state synchronization gracefully
4. WHEN real-time events are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered with minimal latency and proper error handling

### Requirement 6: Advanced Caching and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast application performance so that data loads quickly and the interface remains responsive even with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement multi-layer caching (memory, Redis, database)
2. WHEN API responses are cached THEN the client SHALL serve cached data while revalidating in the background
3. WHEN optimistic updates are made THEN the UI SHALL update immediately and handle conflicts gracefully
4. WHEN offline scenarios occur THEN the application SHALL continue functioning with cached data

### Requirement 7: Integrated Database Access Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible database access patterns so that I can optimize queries for different use cases while maintaining the existing sophisticated backend architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN the system SHALL support direct database access with proper abstraction
2. WHEN simple CRUD operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use the existing repository patterns
3. WHEN database migrations are run THEN they SHALL be coordinated across the entire stack
4. WHEN database schemas change THEN type definitions SHALL be automatically updated across all packages

### Requirement 8: Production-Ready Deployment Strategy

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a unified deployment strategy so that I can deploy the entire stack efficiently with proper orchestration and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL support containerized deployment with proper orchestration
2. WHEN scaling is needed THEN client and server SHALL be independently scalable
3. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide unified observability across the entire stack
4. WHEN environment configurations are managed THEN they SHALL be consistent and secure across all environments

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities so that I can ensure quality across the entire full-stack application with integrated test suites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL run across all packages with unified reporting
2. WHEN integration tests are needed THEN they SHALL test the full client-server communication flow
3. WHEN end-to-end tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate complete user workflows
4. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent test fixtures across all test types

### Requirement 10: Advanced Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable application so that errors are handled gracefully and the system remains functional even when individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly caught, logged, and reported across the entire stack
2. WHEN network failures happen THEN the client SHALL implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the client SHALL display meaningful error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN critical failures happen THEN the system SHALL maintain partial functionality and guide users appropriately

### Requirement 11: Existing Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing sophisticated backend architecture so that all current features and capabilities are maintained while being enhanced with the new full-stack structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all existing backend features SHALL remain fully functional
2. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN the existing Clean Architecture, DDD, and CQRS patterns SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the frontend is integrated THEN it SHALL leverage all existing backend services and capabilities
4. WHEN authentication is used THEN all existing auth methods (JWT, OAuth, WebAuthn, 2FA) SHALL work seamlessly with the frontend

### Requirement 12: Developer Tooling and Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent tooling and development experience so that I can be productive and catch issues early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive TypeScript support with path mapping
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support debugging across the entire stack
3. WHEN code quality is important THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent linting, formatting, and type checking
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL generate API documentation and maintain architectural documentation
