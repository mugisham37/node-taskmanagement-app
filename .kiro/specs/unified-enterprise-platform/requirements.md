# Unified Enterprise Platform - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for combining a high-level enterprise authentication system with a comprehensive task management application into a single, unified Node.js platform. The authentication system will serve as the architectural foundation, with all task management functionalities seamlessly integrated while maintaining enterprise security standards, Domain-Driven Design principles, and modern development practices.

The unified platform will provide secure authentication, comprehensive task management, real-time collaboration, and enterprise-grade features including multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, and compliance capabilities.
