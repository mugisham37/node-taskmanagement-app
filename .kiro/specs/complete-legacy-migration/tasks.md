## Migration Completion Criteria

Each file can ONLY be deleted from the older version when:

- [ ] Every line of meaningful logic has been analyzed and migrated
- [ ] All missing functionalities now exist in appropriate src locations
- [ ] Integration points are established and functional
- [ ] The current src system can perform all operations the old file provided
- [ ] Enhanced functionality maintains backward compatibility where needed
- [ ] Basic functionality testing confirms the migration works

## Expected Outcome

By executing this systematic file-by-file migration:

- The src folder will have 100% of the older version's capabilities
- All functionality will be properly integrated and callable within current architecture
- The system will operate at the highest level with improved structure
- No orphaned or unused code will be introduced
- The older version folder will be completely processed and emptied
- Result: A superior, more capable system with all previous functionality enhanced
