# Complete Legacy Migration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for performing a systematic, file-by-file migration of ALL functionality from the older version project to the current clean architecture. Based on the comprehensive analysis, the older version contains massive amounts of advanced functionality, enterprise-grade features, and sophisticated architecture that must be systematically migrated without losing any logic or capabilities. The migration will follow a direct execution approach where each file is analyzed, compared, migrated, and then deleted from the older version folder.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete File-by-File Migration Process

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want every single file from the older version to be systematically processed and migrated, so that no functionality is lost and the older version folder is completely emptied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration begins THEN every file in the older version SHALL be processed in systematic order
2. WHEN processing each file THEN all functionalities, classes, and logic blocks SHALL be identified and analyzed
3. WHEN comparing with current version THEN equivalent functionality SHALL be identified or marked as missing
4. IF functionality is missing THEN it SHALL be immediately migrated to the appropriate src location
5. WHEN a file is completely processed THEN it SHALL be deleted from the older version folder
6. WHEN migration is complete THEN the older version folder SHALL be empty

### Requirement 2: Direct Architecture Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all migrated functionality to seamlessly integrate with the current Drizzle ORM architecture, so that the system maintains consistency and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating functionality THEN it SHALL follow the current src folder structure using Drizzle ORM
2. WHEN integrating logic THEN it SHALL respect the established Clean Architecture layers
3. WHEN adding new features THEN they SHALL maintain communication patterns between existing layers
4. IF similar functionality exists THEN the superior implementation SHALL be kept
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all logic SHALL be callable and actively used within the system

### Requirement 3: Domain Layer Complete Migration

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want all domain entities, aggregates, value objects, and business rules to be migrated with enhancements, so that the business logic is comprehensive and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating domain entities THEN all business rules and validation logic SHALL be preserved and enhanced
2. WHEN processing aggregates THEN all aggregate roots and entity relationships SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN migrating value objects THEN all immutability and validation rules SHALL be implemented
4. IF domain events exist THEN they SHALL be integrated with the current event system
5. WHEN domain migration is complete THEN all business specifications SHALL be functional

### Requirement 4: Application Layer CQRS Migration

**User Story:** As an application architect, I want all CQRS patterns, command handlers, query handlers, and use cases to be migrated, so that the application layer is fully functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating CQRS components THEN command bus and query bus SHALL be implemented
2. WHEN processing handlers THEN all command and query handlers SHALL be migrated with validation
3. WHEN migrating use cases THEN all business workflows SHALL be preserved and enhanced
4. IF application services exist THEN they SHALL be integrated with current dependency injection
5. WHEN application migration is complete THEN all use cases SHALL be executable

### Requirement 5: Infrastructure Layer Enterprise Features Migration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all infrastructure components including caching, monitoring, security, and external integrations to be migrated, so that the system is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating caching THEN multi-level caching with Redis integration SHALL be implemented
2. WHEN processing monitoring THEN comprehensive observability and metrics SHALL be added
3. WHEN migrating security THEN authentication, authorization, and audit logging SHALL be functional
4. IF backup systems exist THEN they SHALL be integrated with current infrastructure
5. WHEN infrastructure migration is complete THEN all enterprise features SHALL be operational

### Requirement 6: Presentation Layer API Migration

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want all REST endpoints, WebSocket connections, and API documentation to be migrated, so that the system provides comprehensive API coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating controllers THEN all REST endpoints SHALL be implemented with proper validation
2. WHEN processing WebSocket handlers THEN real-time communication SHALL be functional
3. WHEN migrating middleware THEN authentication, rate limiting, and error handling SHALL work
4. IF API documentation exists THEN it SHALL be generated and accessible
5. WHEN presentation migration is complete THEN all APIs SHALL be fully functional

### Requirement 7: Shared Components and Utilities Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all shared utilities, configurations, and common components to be migrated, so that the system has comprehensive support infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating utilities THEN all helper functions and common logic SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN processing configurations THEN environment-specific settings SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN migrating validators THEN all validation rules SHALL be functional
4. IF internationalization exists THEN multi-language support SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN shared migration is complete THEN all utilities SHALL be accessible system-wide

### Requirement 8: Jobs and Background Processing Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all background jobs, scheduled tasks, and automated processes to be migrated, so that the system can handle asynchronous operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating job processors THEN all background tasks SHALL be functional
2. WHEN processing scheduled jobs THEN cron-like scheduling SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN migrating webhook delivery THEN reliable delivery with retries SHALL work
4. IF notification jobs exist THEN they SHALL be integrated with current notification system
5. WHEN jobs migration is complete THEN all automated processes SHALL be operational

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Scripts Migration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all configuration files, deployment scripts, and database migrations to be migrated, so that the system is deployable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating configurations THEN environment-specific settings SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN processing scripts THEN database setup and migration scripts SHALL be functional
3. WHEN migrating Docker configurations THEN containerization SHALL be complete
4. IF deployment scripts exist THEN they SHALL be adapted for current infrastructure
5. WHEN configuration migration is complete THEN the system SHALL be fully deployable

### Requirement 10: Quality Assurance and Integration Verification

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want all migrated functionality to be verified and tested, so that the system maintains high quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating any component THEN it SHALL be verified for integration with existing system
2. WHEN processing logic THEN it SHALL be tested for basic functionality
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN all connections between components SHALL be validated
4. IF performance impact exists THEN it SHALL be measured and optimized
5. WHEN quality verification is complete THEN the system SHALL perform all operations reliably

### Requirement 11: Progressive Enhancement and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want migrated functionality to be enhanced and optimized for the current architecture, so that the system performs better than the original.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating functionality THEN opportunities for enhancement SHALL be identified and implemented
