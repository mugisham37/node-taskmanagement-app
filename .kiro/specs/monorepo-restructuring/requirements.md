# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to restructure the current monorepo to create a perfect full-stack architecture by moving shared components from the server-only implementation to the packages layer. The goal is to eliminate duplication, create proper separation of concerns, and establish a foundation where both client and server can access shared functionality at the highest level.

Currently, the server contains many components that should be shared across the entire application, including domain logic, infrastructure services, shared utilities, and business logic that could benefit both frontend and backend implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain Layer Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the domain layer to be accessible by both client and server applications, so that I can maintain consistent business logic across the full stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain layer is moved to packages THEN it SHALL be accessible by both apps/server and apps/client
2. WHEN domain entities are used THEN they SHALL maintain the same interface and behavior across client and server
3. WHEN domain events are triggered THEN they SHALL be available for both client-side and server-side event handling
4. WHEN domain services are called THEN they SHALL provide consistent business logic regardless of the calling context
5. WHEN domain specifications are evaluated THEN they SHALL work identically on both client and server

### Requirement 2: Infrastructure Services Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want infrastructure services to be abstracted and available as shared packages, so that I can use consistent service interfaces across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure services are abstracted THEN they SHALL provide platform-agnostic interfaces
2. WHEN caching services are used THEN they SHALL work with both client-side and server-side caching mechanisms
3. WHEN external service integrations are needed THEN they SHALL be available through shared service contracts
4. WHEN monitoring and logging are required THEN they SHALL provide unified interfaces for both client and server
5. WHEN security services are accessed THEN they SHALL maintain consistent security policies across the stack

### Requirement 3: Shared Utilities and Constants Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all utilities, constants, and helper functions to be centralized in shared packages, so that I can avoid code duplication and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are needed THEN they SHALL be available from a single shared package
2. WHEN constants are referenced THEN they SHALL come from centralized constant definitions
3. WHEN validation schemas are used THEN they SHALL be shared between client and server validation
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use shared error types and handling utilities
5. WHEN type definitions are needed THEN they SHALL be available from shared type packages

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration management to be enhanced and shared, so that I can maintain consistent configuration across all applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN it SHALL support both client and server environments
2. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN they SHALL be properly typed and validated
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be reflected across all consuming applications
4. WHEN feature flags are used THEN they SHALL be available to both client and server applications
5. WHEN API endpoints are configured THEN they SHALL be shared between client and server

### Requirement 5: Database Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database layer to be properly abstracted, so that I can use consistent data access patterns and potentially support client-side data management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database schemas are defined THEN they SHALL be available as shared types for client applications
2. WHEN query builders are used THEN they SHALL provide type-safe interfaces for both client and server
3. WHEN database migrations are managed THEN they SHALL be centrally controlled and versioned
4. WHEN data validation is performed THEN it SHALL use shared validation schemas
5. WHEN repository patterns are implemented THEN they SHALL support both server-side and potential client-side implementations

### Requirement 6: Testing Infrastructure Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing utilities and infrastructure to be shared, so that I can maintain consistent testing approaches across all applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be available from shared testing packages
2. WHEN mock data is required THEN it SHALL be generated using shared factories and fixtures
3. WHEN test configurations are set up THEN they SHALL provide consistent testing environments
4. WHEN integration tests are written THEN they SHALL use shared testing infrastructure
5. WHEN test assertions are made THEN they SHALL use shared assertion utilities

### Requirement 7: Build and Development Tools Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build tools, linting, and development utilities to be properly shared, so that I can maintain consistent development standards across the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build processes are executed THEN they SHALL use shared build configurations
2. WHEN code linting is performed THEN it SHALL use consistent linting rules across all packages
3. WHEN code formatting is applied THEN it SHALL maintain consistent formatting standards
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN it SHALL use shared TypeScript configurations
5. WHEN development scripts are run THEN they SHALL provide consistent development workflows

### Requirement 8: API and Communication Layer Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API definitions, communication protocols, and data transfer objects to be shared, so that I can maintain type safety and consistency between client and server communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API contracts are defined THEN they SHALL be available as shared types for both client and server
2. WHEN DTOs are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent data structures across the communication layer
3. WHEN WebSocket communication is implemented THEN it SHALL use shared message types and protocols
4. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN they SHALL use shared request/response type definitions
5. WHEN API validation is performed THEN it SHALL use shared validation schemas

### Requirement 9: Security and Authentication Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security utilities, authentication logic, and authorization patterns to be shared, so that I can maintain consistent security across the full stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is performed THEN it SHALL use shared authentication utilities
2. WHEN authorization checks are made THEN they SHALL use shared authorization logic
3. WHEN security tokens are handled THEN they SHALL use shared token management utilities
4. WHEN encryption/decryption is needed THEN it SHALL use shared cryptographic utilities
5. WHEN security policies are enforced THEN they SHALL be consistently applied across client and server

### Requirement 10: Performance and Monitoring Sharing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring, metrics collection, and optimization utilities to be shared, so that I can maintain consistent performance standards across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL use shared metrics collection utilities
2. WHEN monitoring is implemented THEN it SHALL provide consistent monitoring interfaces
3. WHEN performance optimization is applied THEN it SHALL use shared optimization strategies
4. WHEN error tracking is performed THEN it SHALL use shared error tracking utilities
5. WHEN health checks are implemented THEN they SHALL use shared health check patterns
